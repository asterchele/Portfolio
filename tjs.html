                    <h3>4/5</h3>
                    <p>These potstickers are so easy to make, just place them on your steamer over boiling water and they'll 
                        be done in less than 10 minutes!  You can also fry them in a pan if you want a crispy taste.  These
                        are great paired with the Trader Joe's frozen fried rice.

                    <h3>5/5</h3>
                    <p>Whenever I go to Trader Joe's I can't stop myself from getting this cheese.  It's perfect for charcuterie boards
                        paired with TJ's Original Water Crackers and a slice of prosciutto or on top of salads.  The honey flavor is faint yet pulls everything
                        together for this cheese, making you want to finish the whole roll!  Bring this to your next gathering and it's sure
                        to be a hit.

                    <h2>Mandarin Orange Chicken</h2>
                    <h3>3.5/5</h3>
                    <p>I've been eating this frozen chicken for years and usually have it if I want a quick, easy meal.  For a price of around $4.99
                        I can get atleast two meals out of this along with a salad or TJ's fried rice.  Place in the air fryer for 20 minutes, heat up the 
                        sauce an you're good to go.  A con I have for this is that it can feel heavy on the stomach after eating.  It can also be too 
                        breaded where you can't taste the chicken, too.

                    <h2>Almond Ice Cream</h2>
                    <h3>4.5/5</h3>
                    <p>When I first got this, I was a little skeptical of how it would taste, but it definetly did no disappoint.  This non-diary ice 
                        cream fulfills your sweet tooth and in my opinion, is almost as good as normal ice cream.  It's light and sweet taste pairs well
                        with any chocolate dessert and also with the <a href="applecrisp.html">Air Fryer Apple Crisp</a>.  This ice cream is also vegan and 
                        gluten free!
