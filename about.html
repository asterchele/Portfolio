                <p>Hi! My name is Alex Sterchele and I am a Junior at the University of Michigan studying Information Analytics.  Originally from just outside Boston, Massachusetts, I 
                    made the move to Ann Arbor in the fall of 2018.  My first two years of college I relied on campus dining halls or meal plans from my sorority house, however by Junior
                    year I was responsible for paying and making my own meals.    
                    <br>
                    In the fall of my junior year I was given an air fryer for a birthday present and it has changed the game of cooking.  It's easy to use and cooks food way quicker 
                    than putting it in a traditional oven.  Air fryer's also use the air instead of grease to get crispy, allowing a healthier alternative.  
                    <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/air-fryers/best-air-fryers-of-the-year/">Here</a> are some top rated air fryers to get you started if you decide to get one!
                    I can promise that you won't regret it!
                    <br>
                    The more I've cooked on my own, the more I've come to appreciate food along with making it.  All of the recipes on my site are from my own experiences cooking through
                    trial and error.  I've learned it's ok if something doesn't come out as planned-just keep going forward.
